# Addon-Template

This project is a proof of concept for calling c++ in JavaScript using Node addons. The project contains a number of exmaples, including:

-   Calls to a parameterless function
-   Passing/Returning numeric values
-   Passing/Returning only integers
-   Passing/Returning bools

## Usage

-   Run `npm i`
-   If you see "gyp info ok" at the end, everything went okay and you can run `node .` in the "addon" folder to execute the "main.js" file.
